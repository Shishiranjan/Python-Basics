The special syntax *args in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.What *args allows you to do is take in
 more arguments than the number of formal arguments that you previously defined.For example : we want to make a multiply function that takes any number of arguments
 and able to multiply them all together. It can be done using *args.

p1 = program()# Here we call the class program.

The special syntax **kwargs in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list. We use the name kwargs with the double
The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).One can think of the kwargs as being a dictionary that
maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it. That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesnâ€™t seem to be any order in which they were printed
out.
